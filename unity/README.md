Hack day: Mastermind challenge
Unity Group
HOW TO page

Our group belong to the campus of Tunis : Holberton school Tunis with a great location in the city.
The campus is managed by the great Mohamed Amin Ben Amor, a great manager and a good guy.
Fares Nadjar is our 'Software Engineer and Education' Lead in the campus.
And the campus manager is the lovely Hela Ghariani.

I belong to a team of a great young talents looking forward to achieve great carrers and professionel, self developpement.
The five great talents who collaborated in this project are :

- Malek Salem, a twenty years young man 1419@holbertonschool.com
- Mohamed Ali SOuissi, a twenty seven years young man 1426@holbertonschool.com
- Khalil Kefi, a twenty five years youn man 1390@holbertonschool.com
- Mahdi Zaabi, a twenty seven years young man 1655@holbertonschool.com
- Seif Jelidi, a twenty five years young man 1609@holbertonschool.com

For this project we worked with unity language wich includes C# so let's know a little about them.

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies,
first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine.
As of 2018, the engine had been extended to support more than 25 platforms.
The engine can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games,
as well as simulations and other experiences.
The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering and construction.
Several major versions of Unity have been released since its launch. The latest stable version, 2020.1.5, was released in September 2020.  

C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing,
lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,
object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.

The MasterMind game is played using:
a decoding board, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes,
and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
code pegs of six different colors or more, with round heads, which will be placed in the large holes on the board;
and key pegs, some colored black, some white, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs;
they will be placed in the small holes on the board.
There is actually the codemaker or generator, and the player or the codebreaker.
The codemaker generates a pattern of four code pegs.
Duplicates and blanks are allowed depending on player choice,
so the player could even choose four code pegs of the same color or four blanks.
In the instance that blanks are not elected to be a part of the game,
the codebreaker may not use blanks in order to establish the final code.
The chosen pattern is placed in the four holes covered by the shield, visible to the codemaker but not to the codebreaker.
The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within nine turns.
Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board.
Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess.
A colored or black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position.
A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.
