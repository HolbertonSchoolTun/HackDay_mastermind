# Mastermind Challenge

## Challenge

Today, you will implement the game Mastermind.

Easy? Sure, but did you already developed it in SQL? or Cobol?

Also, for each version of the Mastermind, you will have to write an “How to write a Mastermind in XXX?” blog post.

All these “How to” must be hosted in a Github page or in a Blog platform (WordPress, Jekyll, Drupal, etc.) that you will administrated per campus.

## Requirements

    By group of 5~ students (you can regroup based on attendance) - but your evaluation will be as campus!
    Each language can only be used once per campus - advice: take 10-20min at the beginning of the day to dispatch languages.
    Each group must develop at least one Mastermind version - feel free to develop as more as you can - but don’t forget to help your peers!
    You are free of the number of columns, colors and turns.
    Each game can be one player (against a bot) or 2 players
    Only languages bellow are allowed for implementing the Mastermind
    Make it fun!

## You will be evaluated on

    To have a Blog platform OR Github pages live! (to submit by group before midnight on the first task)
    Each group of your campus will have the same score
    The quality of your “How to” posts:
        Presentation of the language
        Algorithm put in place
        User(s) flow to play
        Piece of code related to the algorithm or flow
